## Contributing

### Installing / Getting started

All the dependencies can be install via your yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

That's it! You're up and running, you can start the project with:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Developing

Assuming you're developing with Visual Studio Code (if you're not, you should definitely give it a shot, it's awesome), all you need to develop is this extension: [vscode-reasonml](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/vscode-reasonml).

This will give you compilation errors in the editor and code intelliscence.

### Running Tests

This project uses Jest as a test framework. You can run the tests of the project with:

```bash
yarn test
```

### Creating production builds

To create a production build of the application, you can run:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will output the compiled files in `build/`.
